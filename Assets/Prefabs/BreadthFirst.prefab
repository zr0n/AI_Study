  description: "Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching
    tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node
    of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1]), and explores all of the
    neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next
    depth level.\r\n\r\nIt uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search, which
    instead explores the highest-depth nodes first before being forced to backtrack
    and expand shallower nodes.\n"
